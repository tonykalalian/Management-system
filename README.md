# Introduction

The News Application is a web-based platform that allows users to read and browse the latest news articles across different categories. This repository contains the backend code responsible for handling user authentication, news data management, and serving API endpoints to the frontend application.

# Features

- User authentication (register, login, JWT-based authentication)
- CRUD operations for news articles
- Categorization of news articles
- Secure password storage using bcrypt
- API endpoints to interact with the frontend application

# Technologies

The backend is built using the following technologies:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (with Mongoose ODM)
- JWT for authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing

# Getting Started

To run the backend server locally, follow the steps below:

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-backend.git
cd news-backend
npm install
```
# Configuration
Before running the application, you need to configure the database connection. Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
```bash
dbUrl=??????
JWTSECRETKEY=???????
PORT=3000
````
# Usage
Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The backend server will be running at http://localhost:3000.

# API Endpoints
/api/users: User authentication and management endpoints.
/api/news: Endpoints for managing news articles.
/api/categories: Endpoints for managing news categories.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
